# MDBMatchingMembers

This is my first mini project for MDB (Mobile Developers of Berkeley)

The purpose of this project is to familiarize ourselves with existing members as well as new members.
Simply put, this is a simple, multiple-choice trivia game to see how fast you can learn everyone’s names.

Some basic functionalities of the game includes the following:

- A screen with a button that says start. Upon pressing the button, the user is taken to the main screen.
- Member Picture  - Randomly display a picture of a member on the screen
- Name Options - Display four options below the picture as buttons
- Score - Display a score count for the user
- Answer Display  - You can go from one question to another just by changing the image and button values, but there should be a one second delay in between questions where the
button the user pressed flashes either red or green (depending on whether they’re correct
or not). You’ll have to look up how to implement timers.
- Timer  - Add an additional timer that limits the user to 5 seconds to answer the question. If
they take up the full 5 seconds, the question is counted as incorrect. 
The user should be able to start or stop the game. When the app is first opened, display a “Start” button (at this point, the user should not be able to see any questions on the screen). 
This button should toggle to “Stop” when they click on it. The game should automatically stop if the user goes to a different screen.
- Icon -  Add a statistics icon to the navigation bar of the game. If the user clicks on this, the game should stop (if currently playing) and the screen should segue to a new window that displays the following statistics:
  - Longest streak of correct answers
  - Results of last three questions (or less if not answered yet)

Below are three screenshots of the game:
